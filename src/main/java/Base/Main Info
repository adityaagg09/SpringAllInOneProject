Configuration :- We can set up any class variables to some methods or we want to connect it to some service before running the application then we use it
These are nothing just to mark class different and make a bean of it :)

Beans :- It creates a singleton object of it and can be used we can call the bean name to get the instance of it and need to define all the subclasses present in it through other bean code pieces
Default @Scope is singelton(1 instance per spring container) or Prototype(Every time it creates a new),
Can define bean at method level only not the class level

Autowired :- If we define this on constructor or setter or on a class of a different class then it automatically inject the dependancies; For these feature we need to add the @Configuration anntation
Main autowired :- When spring makes a bean of it then it will call and get the instance of that class which is created initially and oly once :)

Autoboxing :- It is a trick to convert primitive type (int) to Object; int -> Integer extends Object class
UnBoxing :- It opens the wrapper and returns the primitive type (int)
